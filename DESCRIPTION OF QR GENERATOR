QR CODE GENERATOR
This Python program is a QR Code Generator application that uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and
the qrcode library for generating QR codes. The app offers users the ability to create a QR code from entered text and optionally overlay it onto a background image.
This application provides an easy-to-use tool for generating custom QR codes.
Users can personalize the QR code by adding a background image, and then save the QR code as an image file for later use.
The interface is simple, and the integration of Tkinter and Pillow ensures that both the QR code and background image can be handled efficiently.
